NeedlemanWunschAlgorithm
========================

The Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm is an algorithm used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences[...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm)

This repository is modified algorithm.

* Initial match = +2
* Extension of a match = +5
* Mismatch = -1
* Gap = -1

After Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the traceback algorithm works and finds all possible alignment.
